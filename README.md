# **The Automator**

## 🚀 Automating the Entire Analysis Workflow  
*(Probably the most ambitious project I've ever planned lol 😂)*

---

### **Project Overview**  
The Automator is designed to simplify data analysis by automating the entire workflow. From data ingestion and cleaning to building models, making predictions, generating visualizations, and summarizing results, this project aims to handle it all with minimal user intervention.

---

### **Key Features**  
- 📁 **Upload CSV Files**: Seamless file upload interface.  
- 📊 **Automatic Data Exploration**: Descriptive statistics and visual insights generated in seconds.  
- 🤖 **Model Creation**: Build predictive models using integrated algorithms.  
- 📈 **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate and view charts for deeper insights.  
- 📡 **API Integration**: API Support for live data sources (Something We'll Decide in the future).

### **Why This Project?**  
As a Computer Science Grad and current Data science PostGrad, I wanted to create something that combines my existing knowledge of Python Programming , SQL, Software dev in general, while exploring new tools like Flask, APIs, and frontend frameworks. 
The Automator is the culmination of this learning journey where I'll be getting my hands deep into DS/ML concepts and practical applying them here.

---

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Code Prototyping**: Jupyter (Colab)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Frontend**: (To be decided – potential exploration of React/Angular)  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn (and possibly Plotly in the future)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

### **Setup Instructions**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd The-Automator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

### **Future Scope**  
I plan to scale The Automator to include features like real-time data analysis, interactive dashboards, and support for multiple file formats. The ultimate goal is to make data analysis accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.
